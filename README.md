# Interactive-Dictionary
A Python-based command-line tool that functions as an English Dictionary. Definitions are returned for user queried words. The program supports suggestion of similiar words in the event the user mistypes a word using similarity ratio computations.
The dictionary data is provided as a json file for convenience.
